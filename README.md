<p>hello, you are on the laravel project, first upload it to your computer, and do these steps:composer install,npm install,npm run dev,npm run build.Then, when you have done these steps, create a database called six_project, and you will need a command for entering tables:php artisan migrate. Next, in order for the admin to be filled in initially, we will need sidors for roles and admin, we prescribe php artisan migrate --seed</p>
<p>
And so we prescribe the php artisan serve command. Go to our website, go under the admin. And so I say right away to enter the time intervals to a certain user, you click on the calendar of any number, a modal window pops up for you and you enter the data. Now let's go under the user to see how the user works, just also click on the calendar and look at the intervals of his time on a certain date.</p>

<p>And so the key points have been clarified, the admin can: edit the user, delete the user, view customer records, create a user, create a user's work time, set intervals for the user and also specify his break. The user can: view their work intervals for a certain date, as well as set the client statuses: The reception took place, the reception did not take place, the client did not come.A console command has also been created, which every day at 8 o'clock in the morning will send a message to the user about receptions that did not take place or the client did not come. The client can: make an appointment, view users, filter the date</p>
